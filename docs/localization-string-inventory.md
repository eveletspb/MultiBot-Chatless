# Localization String Inventory (Milestone 9 kickoff)

Initial inventory of user-facing hardcoded strings in `Core/`, `UI/`, and `Features/`.

## Method

- Commands used:
  - `rg -n 'SetText\(|tooltipText\s*=|AddLine\(|SendChatMessage\("' Core UI Features`
  - `rg -n 'MultiBot\.L\(\s*"[^"]+"\s*,' Core UI Features`
- Manual filtering was applied to keep only strings visible to users (panel labels, tooltips, tab labels, placeholders).

## Priority candidates

### UI

- `UI/MultiBotOptions.lua`
- Existing options labels/tooltips now route through locale keys without inline fallbacks in runtime call sites.
- `UI/MultiBotPVPUI.lua`
  - PvP panel labels now route through locale keys, with inline fallback duplicates removed in UI call sites.
  - Remaining direct `MultiBot.tips.*` reference (`pvparenanoteamrank`) has been migrated to `MultiBot.L("tips.every.pvparenanoteamrank")`.

### Core

- `Core/MultiBotThrottle.lua`
  - Runtime fallback literal removed from throttle installation message; call site now uses locale key only.
- `Core/MultiBotInit.lua`
  - Runtime localization reads in this file now use `MultiBot.L(...)` key lookups (including previous `MultiBot.tips.*` table reads migrated to locale keys).

### Features

- `Features/MultiBotReward.lua`
  - Whisper command construction is command protocol text, not user-facing labels.
  - No direct panel label migration performed in this kickoff.

## Inline fallback scan snapshot

- Current scan command:
  - `rg -n 'MultiBot\.L\(\s*"[^"]+"\s*,' Core UI Features Strategies`
- The only remaining call site is `UI/MultiBotSpecUI.lua`, where the fallback is a
  dynamically generated specialization title rather than a duplicated English
  literal.

## Legacy tips-read scan snapshot (current)

- Focused scan for legacy table reads:
  - `rg -n 'MultiBot\.tips' Core UI Features`
- Current status:
  - `Core/MultiBotInit.lua`: migrated.
  - `UI/MultiBotPVPUI.lua`: migrated.
  - `Features/MultiBotRaidus.lua`: migrated.
  - `Core/MultiBotEvery.lua`: migrated.
  - `Core/MultiBotEngine.lua`: migrated.
  - `Core/MultiBotHandler.lua`: migrated for runtime tooltip string reads.
  - `Strategies/MultiBotDruid.lua`: migrated.
  - `Strategies/MultiBotPaladin.lua`: migrated.
  - `Strategies/MultiBotMage.lua`: migrated.
  - `Strategies/MultiBotWarlock.lua`: migrated.
  - Remaining major targets in `Strategies/`: none (completed).
  - `Core/MultiBot.lua` remaining `MultiBot.tips` matches are intentional bootstrap lines (`MultiBot.tips = {}` and `MultiBot.tips.spec = ...`), not user-facing runtime tooltip reads.


## Pipeline decisions in this kickoff

- Added a centralized locale access helper (`MultiBot.GetLocaleString` / `MultiBot.L`) with deterministic fallback order:
  1. Active AceLocale table
  2. Registered `enUS` defaults
  3. Per-call fallback string
  4. Locale key itself
- Added dedicated AceLocale registration file (`Locales/MultiBotAceLocale.lua`) to start new keys without rewriting legacy locale files.

## Next milestone-9 increments

1. Continue scanning `Core/UI/Features/Strategies` for any newly introduced user-facing hardcoded strings in incremental PRs.
2. Expand key coverage locale-by-locale while keeping deterministic fallback behavior.
3. Keep class-specific AoE labels routed through locale keys (e.g. `tips.deathknight.dps.frostAoe` / `tips.deathknight.dps.unholyAoe`) instead of inline literals.
4. Keep generic prompt defaults localized/client-localized (e.g. `OKAY` and `MultiBot.info.hunterpeteditentervalue`) instead of inline literals in prompt builders.
5. Use client-localized global constants for Blizzard UI nouns when available (e.g. `SPELLBOOK` instead of inline `"Spellbook"`).
6. Use client-localized role nouns when available (e.g. `PLAYER` instead of inline `"Player"` in stats widgets).
7. Use client-localized status constants when available (e.g. `LOADING` instead of inline loading labels).
8. Route quest-search empty-state text through locale keys (e.g. `tips.quests.gobnosearchdata`) instead of inline literals.

 ## Milestone 9 final status
 - Milestone 9 is now considered complete for the current localization scope.
 - Runtime user-facing reads previously using `MultiBot.tips.*` and `MultiBot.info.*` ... migrated to `MultiBot.L(...)`.
 - Final UI literal pass completed ...
 - Intentional non-migrated literals are limited to technical/protocol identifiers ...

 ## Post-Milestone 9 maintenance
 1. Continue scanning ...
 2. Expand key coverage ...
 3. Keep using client-localized Blizzard globals ...
 4. Keep technical/protocol identifiers unchanged unless the protocol itself is migrated.

## Russian locale completion

The `ruRU` locale is maintained at full key parity with `enUS`. The locale
checker validates:

- missing and unexpected keys;
- duplicate keys;
- ordered `string.format` arguments such as `%s` and `%d`.

Run the checker from the repository root:

```sh
lua tools/check-locales.lua
```

The current `enUS` and `ruRU` dictionaries contain 1037 matching keys.

The Russian quality pass also covers previously untranslated Spanish, French,
and English UI text. Technical identifiers and protocol commands remain
unchanged where translating them would make the interface less precise, for
example `RTI`, `DPS`, `Playerbot`, and `co +focus`.

Before committing localization changes:

```sh
lua tools/check-locales.lua
git diff --name-only -- '*.lua' | xargs -n 1 luac -p
git diff --check
```

After static validation, smoke-test the addon on a `ruRU` client. At minimum,
check the main bot menu, pull controls, inventory, quest tooltips, inspect
tooltip, reward selection, PvP panel, character information, outfits, and
trainer actions.
